# What I Actually Tested

## My Direct Tests (that worked):
1. test-plain
2. test-special-chars
3. test-code-blocks
4. test-sidebar
5. test-combined
6. insolvency-simple

## What I NEVER Tested Directly:
1. exam-assistant (l-extract) - 12KB
2. exam-assistant-minimal (l-extract) - 1.2KB
3. knowledge-assistant (l-extract) - 11KB

## The Gap

I tested SMALL agents successfully.
I never tested the ACTUAL exam-assistant agents myself.

User tested those, and they crashed.

## New Test Needed

Let me invoke exam-assistant-minimal DIRECTLY (like I did with test-plain) to see if it works when I test it, or if it crashes regardless of who invokes it.
