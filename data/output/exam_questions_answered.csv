An absolute discharge","On the hearing of an application of a bankrupt for a discharge, other than a bankrupt referred to in section 172.1, the court may (a) grant or refuse an absolute order of discharge","Section 172(1)(a)","BIA Statute","Section 173 (facts that require refusal/suspension/conditions), Section 178 (debts surviving discharge)","database_query + study_materials","SELECT section_number, full_text FROM bia_sections WHERE section_number = '172' OR section_number = '173'","Section 172(2) states that the court SHALL refuse, suspend, or grant conditional discharge only 'on proof of any of the facts referred to in section 173.' The question specifies NO facts under s.173 are proven. Therefore, section 172(2) does NOT apply. Section 172(1)(a) gives the court discretion to 'grant or refuse an absolute order of discharge' when s.173 facts are not proven. An absolute discharge is the standard outcome when no s.173 facts exist."
