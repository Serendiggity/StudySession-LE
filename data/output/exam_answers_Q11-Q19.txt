├─ A: ⚠️  INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION FOUND
│
├─ Evidence Found:
│   • Directive 16R: "Where a partnership is involved, a Statement of Affairs must be prepared for the business as well as for each of the partners making an assignment."

│   • BIA Section 2: "person includes a partnership"
│
├─ Analysis: Directive 16R states "each of the partners making an assignment" (plural), suggesting all partners make assignments. However, NO DIRECT QUOTE found stating WHO SIGNS the assignment documents.

┌─ Q15: The trustee is required to publish the Notice of Bankruptcy and First Meeting of Creditors in a local newspaper. What is the purpose of this publication of the notice?
│
├─ A: ✅ To inform the general public with whom the debtor is dealing that he is no longer operating
│
├─ Quote: "The notice also explains the bankrupt's legal status to anyone who may do business with him."
│
├─ Full Context: "At least five days before the meeting (in an ordinary bankruptcy), the Trustee must publish a notice in the local newspaper announcing details of the meeting. This is for the benefit of any other creditors who may have been omitted from the list in the Statement of Affairs. The notice also explains the bankrupt's legal status to anyone who may do business with him."
│
├─ Why: The quote directly states the notice "explains the bankrupt's legal status to anyone who may do business with him" - this matches answer choice about informing general public with whom debtor is dealing. Primary purpose is to inform those who might deal with the bankrupt of their legal status.
