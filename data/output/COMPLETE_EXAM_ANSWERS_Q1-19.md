## ✅ Q11: Partnership Assignment Execution

**Question:** If all the members of an unlimited partnership decide to file an assignment in bankruptcy, who will execute the assignment documents?

**Answer:** ✅ **(d) All the partners are required to sign all the assignment documents**

**Evidence:**
- BIA Rules §114: "**each bankrupt partner shall submit** a statement of their own personal affairs"
- Directive 16R §7: "**each of the partners making an assignment**"
- BIA §85(1): "**all the general partners** of a limited partnership becoming bankrupt"

**Inference:** Consistent plural language ("each", "all") indicates all partners must participate.

⚠️ **Note:** No single direct quote about assignment execution, but multiple sources use plural requirements.

**Question:** What is the purpose of this publication of the notice?

**Direct Quote (Directive 23):**
> "The publication requirement under section 102(4) of the Act is intended to inform all creditors who may have been omitted from the list of creditors. It is also to **advise the general public with whom the debtor has been dealing in the past, is dealing with currently or will be dealing in the future**."

## ✅ Q16 & Q19 (DUPLICATE): Publication Standards

**Question:** Which of the following are prescribed standards for the publication?

**Answer:** ✅ **(c) The reasonable width of the notice is usually one column**

**Direct Quote (Directive 23 §9):**
> "Publication of the notice is not to be used as a means of publicity for the trustee. The name, address and logo of the trustee should be of a reasonable size in relation to the rest of the notice. **The reasonable width of an advertisement is normally one column.**"

**Why each option:**
- **(a) Logo may be included as publicity** - ❌ FALSE
  - Quote: "**NOT to be used as a means of publicity** for the trustee"
  - Logo must be "reasonable size" (minimized), not for publicity

- **(b) Any form up to 2x2 column** - ❌ FALSE
  - Not mentioned in Directive 23
  - Contradicts "one column" standard

- **(c) Reasonable width is one column** - ✅ **CORRECT**
  - Direct quote: "normally one column"

- **(d) Reasons for meeting must be included** - ❌ Not required
  - Form 73 specifies required content (name, address, meeting details)
  - "Reasons" not listed as mandatory

**Direct Quote (Directive 23 §5(b)):**

**Direct Exclusions (Directive 23 §7):**
> "**A magazine, a specialized publication or a weekend edition of a newspaper does not satisfy the requirements** of this Directive."

- **(c) A specialized publication** - ❌ **Explicitly EXCLUDED** by §7
