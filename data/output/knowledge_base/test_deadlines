Insolvency Administration modules;\n2. Competency assessments;\n3. Reference glossary.\nProgram rules\nTo follow the program, you will also require the IA Course Policy and Guidelines –\navailable on our website www.cairp.ca. Please read this document carefully as it contains\nimportant information on the program.\nCompetency Assessments (CAs)\nEach module has a matching Competency Assessment component, which is to be completed\nonline.

The underlying principle however, is that the Trustee remains\nresponsible for the administration being completed professionally and in a timely manner.\nUse of “you”\nWhen the pronoun “you” is used in this course, it does not necessarily mean you\npersonally—it means either the Trustee or the Insolvency Administrator.\nDisclaimer / Rules of the Road\n1. While we are committed to gender equality, we have sacrificed the goal of using gender\nneutral language in this course material to keep the text grammatically simple. So, for\nexample, references to insolvency professionals that are in the singular are generally\nthird person masculine (in other words, “he” rather than “he or she”).\n2. The material in the CQP program can be time sensitive. Notwithstanding all of the efforts\nof the professionals involved in the preparation and review of these notes, some errors\nmay be present. You should review the material carefully with your sponsor, with a\ncritical thinking approach and bring to the attention of the sponsors and CAIRP any\nmaterial that is not clear.\n3. The Office of the Superintendent (“OSB”) Directives are described in the text in generic\nterms. It is up to you to research and become familiar with the latest versions of these\ndirectives. For example, the Directive on Surplus Income is referred to in the text as\nDirective 11R and not as Directive 11R2.\n4. A deliberate decision has been made in the preparation of the course materials to refer\nonly to sections of the legislation, such as the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (“BIA”) and\nthe Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (“CCAA”), and not to subsections. The intent\nis to encourage you to read all parts of the acts and not just specific sections so that the\nrelevant provisions can be looked at in context.\n\nInsolvency Administration | July 2020 12\nAssess debtor’s financial situation\nSecure Trustee’s interest\nThe First Meeting of Creditors\nProofs of claim\nPrepare documents for OSB; submit\nValue assets: research methods of sale\nIntroduction to insolvency\nBankruptcy administration process overview\n•Information resources •Glossary •Roles & duties of stakeholders\nDivision I Proposal administration process overview\nStay of proceedings\n2\n6\n4\n9\n10\nTrustee’s preliminary report\n Trustee’s report to creditors in a Division I, Consumer Proposal\nRealization of assets\n Administer Division I Proposal\nAdminister discharge of debtor, incl. s. 170 report\nMonitor file; ensure completeness; organize & close file\nAdminister discharge of Trustee\nAdminister receivership\nBankruptcy\n Proposal\nConsumer Proposal administration process overview\nAdminister Consumer Proposal\n15\n1.

Introduction\nModule objectives\nAt the end of this module, you will be able to:\n Describe the various roles a Trustee can or cannot accept.\n Explain how Trustees receive their designations, how they are licensed and by whom.\n Know and understand the rules governing a Trustee’s behaviour (and those in his\nemploy) allowing you to adhere strictly to them.\n Understand that there are various provincial and federal legislations which impact the\nday-to-day administration of estates.\nAssigned reading\n BIA s. 2, 13.3-13.5, 16-38, 161 and 178\n BIA Rules 34-53\n Directive 5 - Estate Funds and Banking\n CAIRP Rules of Professional Conduct; CAIRP Standards of Professional Practice\n1.1.1. Philosophy\nBankruptcy and insolvency legislation has the following primary goals:\n Financial rehabilitation: to allow an honest but unfortunate debtor the ability to obtain a\nfresh start unfettered by an insurmountable debt load; to obtain a discharge from his\ndebts on reasonable conditions;\n Compromise: to facilitate a process whereby an individual or a business can discuss a\nsettlement of an unmanageable debt load with the creditors to avoid bankruptcy and the\nresulting loss of value and social impacts, by compelling creditors to act collectively rather\nthan individually;\n Collective process: to provide for an orderly and fair distribution of available proceeds to\nthe creditors in an equitable manner;\n Investigation: to provide a forum to carry out an investigation into the affairs and\ntransactions of the insolvent person; and\n Confidence: to assist the credit granting system by promoting confidence of all the\nstakeholders in the insolvency process.\n\nInsolvency Administration | July 2020 16\n1.1.2. What is insolvency?\nWhile the terms bankruptcy and insolvency are often used interchangeably, in fact, they are\nnot one and the same. A person who is bankrupt is usually insolvent, but an insolvent person\nis not always bankrupt.\nA bankrupt person has either filed an assignment in bankruptcy or has been petitioned into\nbankruptcy by a creditor and is now subject to the provisions of the BIA.\nInsolvency is the financial situation a person finds himself in when he is unable to pay his\ndebts when they are due, or has ceased making payments, or his liabilities exceed the value\nof his assets.\nThe BIA is a rehabilitative act that offers an insolvent person an opportunity to be released\nfrom his debts. It also offers creditors an orderly wind-up and distribution of a bankrupt’s\nrealizable assets.\n1.1.3. Who is the Trustee?\nA Trustee is an officer of the court who owes a duty of care to all stakeholders.\nA Trustee operates in a position of trust and must maintain a high standard of ethics in the\nadministration of his duties.\nA Trustee can delegate certain duties, but is ultimately responsible for all actions taken by\nindividuals under his supervision.\nThere is an inherent conflict of interest in the role of the Trustee as the Trustee has\nobligations to both the creditors and the debtor. Both the Office of the Superintendent of\nBankruptcy and CAIRP have established codes of conduct to address these conflicts and\nensure that the insolvency process remains transparent.\n1.2. Rules of conduct and ethics\nBIA Rules 34-53\nCAIRP Rules of Professional Conduct; CAIRP Standards of Professional Practice\n1.2.1. Ethics\nThe Superintendent of Bankruptcy is responsible for overseeing estates administered under\nthe BIA and has established a Code of Ethics that is set out in the BIA.\nThis code, together with the BIA and the Directives, deals with the competency and integrity\nof Trustees and establishes standards of care required in the administration of the estates\nand the operation of an insolvency practice.\nCAIRP also issues Rules of Professional Conduct and has established the Standards of\nProfessional Practice that are found on the CAIRP website, www.cairp.ca.\n\nInsolvency Administration | July 2020 17\nThese codes of conduct establish standards that deal not only with trustees but also with\nother parties, e.g., receivers, agents, or liquidators involved in the insolvency and\nrestructuring process.\n1.3. History of statutes and the profession\nBankruptcy legislation was first enacted in Canada shortly after Confederation. Aside from\nthe period between 1880 and 1919 there has been some form of legislation in place. On July\n1, 1950, the Bankruptcy Act came into force. This allowed for the filing of proposals by nonbankrupt individuals, as well as a provision for the administration of summary estates1.\nIn November 1992 significant amendments were made and the act was renamed the\nBankruptcy and Insolvency Act. Further amendments to the Act came into force in 1997 and\n1998. The most recent amendments came into force in July 2008 and September 2009.\nOther Acts that regulate bankruptcy and insolvency in Canada include:\n Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA)\n Enacted in 1933.\n Provides for the financial restructuring of a company or related group of companies\nwith debts of more than $5,000,000 under court supervision.\n Winding-up and Restructuring Act (WURA)\n Enacted in 1882.\n Provides for the winding-up of insolvent banks, insurance companies and trust\ncompanies under a liquidator. These companies are excluded from utilizing the\nprovisions of the BIA.\n Farm Debt Mediation Act (FDMA)\n Enacted in 1998.\n Provides for the restructuring of insolvent commercial farmers under an Administrator\nappointed by the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food.\n\n1 An estate in which, at the time of filing, unencumbered, realizable assets are valued at $15,000 or less. Certain provisions of\nthe Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act are waived in order to reduce administration time and costs.\n\nInsolvency Administration | July 2020 18\n1.4. Current legislation\n1.4.1. Legislative framework\nThe Parliament of Canada has exclusive jurisdiction over bankruptcy and insolvency matters\nand the BIA is federal legislation that is applicable across the country.\nThe BIA is broken down into 13 parts. Also, the Bankruptcy and Insolvency General Rules,\nEligible Financial Contract General Rules and Orderly Payment of Debts Regulations\ncomplete the BIA by providing more information on matters that are more administrative or\nprocedural. Directives and Circulars are issued by the Superintendent of Bankruptcy and help\ninterpret the provisions of the BIA or provide practice notes designed to make the\nadministration of estates more uniform. Finally, jurisprudence completes the legislation by\nproviding interpretations of the provisions that are useful in administering estates.\nOther federal legislation that can impact on the BIA includes, but is not limited to, the\nfollowing:\n Income Tax Act\n Excise Tax Act\n Canada Pension Plan Act\n Employment Insurance Act\n Bank Act\n Canada Business Corporations Act\nProvincial legislation that impacts the BIA includes, but is not limited to the following:\n Exemptions/Execution Act\n Landlord and Tenant Act\n Fraudulent Conveyances Act\n Assignment & Preferences Act\n Personal Property Security Act\n Employment Standards Act\n Workers Compensation Act\n Labour Relations Act\n Pension Benefits Act\n Family Law Act\n Retail/Harmonized Sales Tax Act\n\nInsolvency Administration | July 2020 19\n Municipal Act\n Public Utilities Act\n Partnership Act\n Creditors Relief Act\n Construction/Builders Lien Act\n Conditional Sales Act\n Civil Enforcement Act\n Insurance Act\n In Quebec, the Civil Code; Code of Civil Procedure; Tax Administration Act\nThe individual provinces have jurisdiction over property and civil rights legislation.\nThe provisions of the BIA are subject to provincial legislation involving property and civil\nrights as long as the legislation does not conflict with it.\n1.5.

OSB directives\nFrom time to time, the Superintendent of Bankruptcy issues directives to aid in the\nadministration of the BIA.\nThese directives carry the same statutory authority as the BIA.
