    For a debtor to file a proposal, the proposal must be more beneficial than bankruptcy. The
    Trustee will review the options available with the debtor during the assessment and the
    debtor will choose his best option. It is important to note that the final decision has to be the
    debtor's, as he is the party affected by this decision.

    Can I change my
    mind after filing a
    proposal and
    request that it be
    withdrawn?

    No â€“ there is no possibility of
    backtracking without special
    permission from the court. If
    the proposal is not filed or not
    accepted, a bankruptcy
    occurs.
