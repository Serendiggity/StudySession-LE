Radiology Imaging Guidelines - Sample Material

1. CHEST X-RAY (CXR)

1.1 Indications
The radiologist shall order a chest x-ray when the patient presents with:
- Suspected pneumonia or respiratory infection
- Persistent cough lasting more than 3 weeks
- Chest pain or shortness of breath
- Suspected cardiac abnormality

1.2 Procedure
The technologist shall position the patient in posterior-anterior (PA) view.
The patient must hold their breath for 3-5 seconds during exposure.
Two views are required: PA and lateral.

1.3 Common Findings
- Consolidation: Indicates possible pneumonia
- Pleural effusion: Fluid accumulation in pleural space
- Cardiomegaly: Enlarged heart, cardiothoracic ratio > 0.5
- Nodules: Require follow-up CT if diameter > 8mm

1.4 Reporting Requirements
The radiologist must issue a report within 24 hours of imaging.
For critical findings (pneumothorax, large mass), the radiologist shall notify the referring physician immediately.


2. COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT)

2.1 CT Chest - High Resolution (HRCT)

Indications:
- Interstitial lung disease
- Suspected pulmonary embolism (with contrast)
- Characterization of nodules found on chest x-ray

Procedure:
The technologist shall administer contrast agent if ordered.
The patient must lie supine with arms raised above head.
Slice thickness: 1-2mm for high resolution studies.

Contraindications:
- Renal insufficiency (eGFR < 30) for contrast studies
- Pregnancy (relative contraindication)
- Allergy to iodinated contrast without prophylaxis

Radiation Dose:
Typical effective dose: 7-8 mSv (chest CT)
Dose reduction protocols should be used for pediatric patients.

2.2 Findings Requiring Urgent Action

If the radiologist identifies any of the following, they must contact the referring physician within 1 hour:
- Pulmonary embolism
- Pneumothorax
- Large pleural effusion requiring drainage
- Suspected aortic dissection
- Large mass with mediastinal invasion


3. MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI)

3.1 MRI Brain

Indications:
- Suspected stroke or transient ischemic attack
- Headache with neurological signs
- Suspected brain tumor or metastasis
- Multiple sclerosis evaluation

Contraindications:
- Pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)
- Metallic foreign body in eye
- Cochlear implants (most models)
- First trimester of pregnancy (relative)

Sequences Required:
- T1-weighted: Anatomy, hemorrhage
- T2-weighted: Edema, inflammation
- FLAIR: White matter lesions
- DWI: Acute infarction (within 6 hours)
- Post-contrast T1: Enhancement patterns (tumors, inflammation)

3.2 Reporting Timeline
The radiologist shall issue preliminary report within 2 hours for suspected stroke.
Final report must be issued within 24 hours for routine studies.


4. ULTRASOUND

4.1 Abdominal Ultrasound

Common Indications:
- Right upper quadrant pain (suspected gallstones)
- Hepatomegaly or suspected liver disease
- Abdominal mass or ascites
- Renal evaluation

Procedure:
Patient must fast for 6 hours prior to examination.
The sonographer shall document liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, and aorta.

Common Findings:
- Cholelithiasis: Gallstones with posterior acoustic shadowing
- Hepatic steatosis: Bright liver echotexture
- Renal calculi: Echogenic foci with shadowing
- Hydronephrosis: Dilated renal collecting system

Follow-up Recommendations:
If a solid mass is identified, the radiologist should recommend:
- CT or MRI for further characterization
- Biopsy if malignancy suspected
- Follow-up ultrasound in 3-6 months for indeterminate findings


5. QUALITY ASSURANCE

5.1 Image Quality Standards
All images must meet diagnostic quality criteria.
The radiologist may reject suboptimal studies and request repeat imaging.
Acceptable repeat rate: < 5% of all examinations.

5.2 Radiation Safety
The medical physicist shall conduct annual surveys of radiation dose levels.
Dose reference levels (DRLs) must be established for each examination type.
Any patient receiving dose > 2x DRL must be documented and reviewed.


6. CONTRAST REACTIONS

6.1 Risk Categories

Low Risk (< 1% incidence):
- Nausea
- Hives
- Flushing

Moderate Risk (0.1-1% incidence):
- Bronchospasm
- Laryngeal edema
- Hypotension

High Risk (< 0.01% incidence):
- Anaphylaxis
- Cardiac arrest
- Death

6.2 Management Protocol

For mild reactions:
- Monitor patient for 30 minutes
- Administer antihistamines if needed

For moderate reactions:
- Notify physician immediately
- Administer epinephrine 0.3mg IM if bronchospasm
- Supplemental oxygen

For severe reactions:
- Activate emergency response team
- Administer epinephrine 1mg IV
- Initiate CPR if needed
- Transfer to emergency department


7. CROSS-SECTIONAL IMAGING COMPARISON

Modality Selection Guidelines:

Chest Imaging:
- Initial evaluation: Chest X-ray
- Pulmonary embolism: CT angiography
- Mediastinal mass: CT or MRI
- Cardiac: MRI or Echocardiography

Abdominal Imaging:
- Initial RUQ pain: Ultrasound
- Trauma: CT
- Liver lesion characterization: MRI
- Appendicitis: CT (adults), Ultrasound (pediatric)

Neurological Imaging:
- Acute stroke: CT head (initial), MRI (follow-up)
- Multiple sclerosis: MRI brain and spine
- Headache: MRI if neurological signs, otherwise CT
- Trauma: CT
