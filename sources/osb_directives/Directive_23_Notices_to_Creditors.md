## Policy

### Purpose of Publication Requirement

The publication requirement under section 102(4) of the Act is intended to:
1. Inform all creditors who may have been omitted from the list of creditors
2. **Advise the general public with whom the debtor has been dealing in the past, is dealing with currently or will be dealing in the future**

### Newspaper Selection

The notice of the first meeting of creditors must be published in a **major newspaper that is read by a large segment of the population in the geographic locality of the debtor**.

Depending on the locality of the debtor, the publication shall be in either official language and:

**(a)** in a metropolitan area, be in a major daily subscribed newspaper;

**(b)** in localities outside a metropolitan area where a local subscribed newspaper is published, be in the daily newspaper published locally. If such local publication is not available, the publication shall be in a **weekly subscribed newspaper published locally**;

**(c)** in a locality outside a metropolitan area where there are no newspapers published locally, be in the daily or weekly subscribed newspaper generally read by the population of the locality.

### Alternative Publications

In some regions, a regional newspaper, approved by the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy, could be an appropriate replacement for the newspapers designated under section 5.

### Exclusions

**A magazine, a specialized publication or a weekend edition of a newspaper does NOT satisfy the requirements of this Directive.**

### Required Form and Content

Publication must be in accordance with the **prescribed form (Form 73)**, including the elements contained therein:
