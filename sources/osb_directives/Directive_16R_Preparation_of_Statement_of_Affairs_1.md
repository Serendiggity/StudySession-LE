# DIRECTIVE 16R - PREPARATION OF THE STATEMENT OF AFFAIRS

**Consumer and Corporate Affairs Canada**  
**Superintendent of Bankruptcy**

**Issued:** December 15, 1988  
**Reissued:** January 10, 1991

---

## PURPOSE

This Directive revises and replaces Directive #16 issued December 22, 1986 as well as any previously issued policies on this matter.

## BACKGROUND

1. The Statement of Affairs is one of the most important documents for the administration of the estate and one on which a variety of users, the Court, the trustee, the creditors, the inspectors and the Official Receiver, base their decisions.

2. Although the Statement of Affairs is the debtor's statement, the trustee often assists in its preparation on the basis of the information provided by the debtor. As the preparation of the Statement of Affairs is normally done by the trustee, the time spent is a normal and acceptable charge to the estate.

3. Whereas financial statements prepared by professional accountants will normally be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, such is not the case for a Statement of Affairs where there are no guidelines. There are concerns that the manner in which it is prepared in numerous instances leads to confusion and misunderstanding.

4. The multiplicity of ways in which assets and liabilities have been treated for the purpose of the preparation of the Statement of Affairs have often led to a distorted picture of the actual situation of the debtor leading to unreliable criteria on which decisions by the creditors, the Official Receiver and the trustee are made.

## GUIDELINES

5. While assisting a debtor in preparing his Statement of Affairs, trustees are expected to make an effort by using their experience and skill to improve the full disclosure of all the necessary information and help the debtor to provide information which is proper and as accurate as possible, having regard to the circumstances and to the provincial exemptions and legislations.

6. Form 74A - Statement of Affairs of a Non-Business Bankrupt is to be used for all consumer debtors and non-business bankruptcies whether the estate is administered under the summary administration provisions or under the regular provisions of the Act. Form 74 - Statement of Affairs is to be used for all other proceedings.

7. Where a partnership is involved, a Statement of Affairs must be prepared for the business as well as for each of the partners making an assignment.

8. For the purpose of this Directive, a consumer debtor is defined as an individual:
   - (a) who has no business assets; and who is not currently active in business; (commissioned salespersons or individuals in similar occupations should be classified as consumer debtors)
   - (b) indebtedness resulting from guarantees or endorsements of a corporation or a third party operating a business does not constitute a debt arising out of the operation of a business.

9. Notwithstanding paragraph 6, in those cases where the use of the alternate form could be more appropriate, the trustee shall consult the Official Receiver as to the acceptability of using the alternate form.

10. In completing the Statement of Affairs or the Statement of Affairs of a Non-Business Bankrupt:

    (a) the full name and complete address of each creditor is to be shown, additional creditors not shown on the list should be shown as a separate list;

    (b) where the exact or approximate amount owed or where the value of the asset is not known, the "best estimate" of the amount involved is to be included and the debtor is to refrain from using a question mark in the "estimated dollar value of assets" or the "amount of debt" columns of Form 74A or in the "assets" or "liabilities" columns of Form 74;

    (c) in those cases where it is not possible to determine an amount because of its contingent nature, an explanation is to be provided as to why an amount cannot be indicated (i.e. - tax refund unknown, judgment not yet rendered);

    (d) where a property is jointly or partially owned, the situation is to be reflected in the Statement of Affairs with the debtor's share of the property, the share of the secured encumbrances that he is directly responsible for as well as any possible contingent claims as he is, with the other co-owner(s), jointly and severely responsible for all of the encumbrances against the property;

    (e) where the debtor cannot ascertain if an amount is or could be owed to a creditor, but wants to include the said creditor. The creditor should be shown on the Statement of Affairs as a supplementary creditor without any amount or question mark in the dollar amount column;

    (f) appendices "A" and "B" indicate how individual elements of assets and liabilities are to be dealt with or presented on the Statement of Affairs;

    (g) the appendices attached to the Statement of Affairs are to be fully completed to provide all the details to substantiate the amounts appearing on the front page of the Statement of Affairs; and

    (h) the front page of a business Statement of Affairs (Form 74) should be sent to creditors with the notice to creditors of the first meeting and the list of creditors. In the case of a Non-business Statement of Affairs (form 74A), the Statement of Affairs and all the appendices are to be sent to the creditors.

11. In view of section 22 of the Act, which limits the obligation to make any return that the bankrupt was required to make to one year prior to the commencement of the calendar year, the trustee could limit the taking of possession of documents to the period necessary to prepare these reports. In practical terms, this could involve a period of approximately two years depending on the date of the bankruptcy except for those records that, in the opinion of the trustee, would not be required.
