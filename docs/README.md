## 💡 Tips for Success

### Before Starting Implementation

- [ ] Read all 6 planning documents (4-5 hours total)
- [ ] Set up Google AI Studio account and get API key
- [ ] Install Python 3.10+ and set up virtual environment
- [ ] Verify you can extract text from your PDF
- [ ] Block out dedicated time for Phase 3 (example creation)

### During Implementation

- [ ] Follow Implementation Plan phases in order
- [ ] Don't skip Phase 3 (example creation) - quality here is critical!
- [ ] Test frequently with small samples before full extraction
- [ ] Track API costs using the cost management tools
- [ ] Take breaks during tedious work (example creation)
- [ ] Celebrate milestones (first extraction, first quiz, etc.!)

### If You Get Stuck

1. **Re-read** the relevant planning document section
2. **Check** the Implementation Plan for troubleshooting tips
3. **Review** examples in Schema Specification for patterns
4. **Test** with smaller samples to isolate issues
5. **Refine** examples and try again (iterative approach is expected!)
