# Exam Pattern Analysis
## Data-Driven Section Frequency Based on Actual Questions

This document tracks which BIA sections and Study Material topics appear in actual exam questions. Use this to prioritize study focus based on validated exam patterns.

## How to Use This System

**When you complete a quiz/exam:**
1. Record each question's source section below
2. Update frequency counts
3. AI can then prioritize high-frequency sections

**Toggle Feature:**
- Include `#DATASET_NAME` when querying AI to apply specific exam patterns
- Example: "What are common topics? #MODULE_QUIZ"
- AI will prioritize sections from that dataset

- BIA s. 2 (Definitions) - Foundational
- Study Material Ch. 1 (Ethics/Professional Practice) - Professional conduct focus

**Question Patterns:**
- Negative questions: "Which is NOT true..." (test understanding of limits)
- Multi-condition questions: Tested ability to read complex provisions
- Cross-source: Required both BIA and Study Material

## AI Assistant Integration

### How to Use Dataset Tags

**In your prompts to AI:**

```
Standard query (no dataset):
"What are the extension time limits?"
→ AI uses general navigation guide

Dataset-specific query:
"What are common trustee qualification questions? #MODULE_QUIZ"
→ AI prioritizes BIA s. 13.3 (appeared 2x in Module Quiz)

Multiple datasets:
"What topics should I focus on? #MODULE_QUIZ #2022_PAST_QUESTIONS"
→ AI aggregates frequency from both datasets
```

### Dataset Commands

**Available tags:**
- `#MODULE_QUIZ` - Apply learnings from Module Quiz (10 questions, 100% score)
- `#2022_PAST_QUESTIONS` - (Not yet populated)
- `#ALL_EXAMS` - Aggregate across all datasets

---

## How to Update This File

**After each quiz/exam:**

1. Add new dataset section
2. Record which BIA section each question tested
3. Update aggregated frequency counts
4. Note new patterns or question types

**Over time, this builds REAL exam intelligence based on YOUR actual test experience.**
