## Q1: Majority in Value for Consumer Proposal Voting

**Question:** What constitutes a majority in value when voting on a consumer proposal?
- A) 50%
- B) 50% plus 1
- C) 51%
- D) 66.67%

```
┌─ Q: What constitutes a majority in value when voting on a consumer proposal?
│
├─ A: ✅ C) 51%
│
├─ Quote: "At a meeting of creditors, the creditors may by ordinary resolution, voting
│          all as one class, accept or refuse the consumer proposal" §66.19(1)
│
│          "all questions at meetings of creditors shall be decided by resolution carried
│          by the majority of votes, and for that purpose the votes of a creditor shall be
│          calculated by counting one vote for each dollar" §115
│
├─ Why: Consumer proposals require "ordinary resolution" §66.19(1) which means simple
│        majority. §115 defines majority as more than 50% where $1 = 1 vote. This equals
│        51% (anything over 50%). Option D (66.67% = 2/3) is the Division I requirement
│        per §54(2)(d), NOT Division II. Options A (exactly 50%) and B (50% + $1) are
│        technically less precise than C (51%).

## Q2: Consequences of Default

**Question:** What are the consequences to an insolvent debtor upon a default in a consumer proposal?
- A) The rights of the creditors are revived
- B) The insolvent debtor is responsible for all claims of creditors
- C) The insolvent debtor may make another consumer proposal
- D) The debtor is deemed to have filed an assignment in bankruptcy

```
┌─ Q: What are the consequences to an insolvent debtor upon a default in a consumer proposal?
│
├─ A: ✅ A) The rights of the creditors are revived
│
├─ Quote: "Where a consumer proposal is annulled or deemed annulled, the rights of the
│          creditors are revived for the amount of their claims less any dividends received."
│          §66.32(2)
│
├─ Why: Default leads to deemed annulment (§66.31), which then triggers §66.32(2) - creditor
│        rights are revived. Option B is misleading (responsible for balance, not "all" claims -
│        dividends are deducted). Option C is WRONG (§66.32(1)(a) prohibits another consumer
│        proposal). Option D is WRONG (deemed assignment only if debtor was already bankrupt
│        per §66.31(4), otherwise NOT automatic bankruptcy).

## Q3: Effect of Annulment

**Question:** What is the effect of an annulment on a failed consumer proposal?
- A) The debtor may make another consumer proposal
- B) The debtor is entitled to continued relief under Sec. 69 to 69.2 of the BIA
- C) The rights of the creditors are revived for the amount of their claim less any dividend received
- D) The debtor is automatically deemed bankrupt

```
┌─ Q: What is the effect of an annulment on a failed consumer proposal?
│
├─ A: ✅ C) The rights of the creditors are revived for the amount of their claim less any
│          dividend received
│
├─ Quote: "Where a consumer proposal is annulled or deemed annulled, the rights of the
│          creditors are revived for the amount of their claims less any dividends received."
│          §66.32(2)
│
├─ Why: This is word-for-word from §66.32(2). Option A is explicitly FALSE (§66.32(1)(a)
│        says "may NOT make another consumer proposal" unless court orders). Option B is
│        FALSE (§66.32(1)(b) says "NOT entitled to any relief provided by sections 69 to 69.2").
│        Option D is FALSE (NOT automatic bankruptcy unless already bankrupt per §66.31(4)).
│

## Q4: Administrator Action When Debtor Cannot Continue Payments

**Question:** What should the administrator do when he realizes that a consumer debtor cannot continue with the payments required under a consumer proposal?
- A) Advise the consumer debtor to consider filing an amendment to the consumer proposal, prior to the proposal being deemed annulled
- B) Immediately call a meeting of creditors in order to inform all creditors
- C) Inform the OSB of the consumer debtor's inability to continue with the required payments
- D) Apply to court for the annulment of the consumer proposal

```
┌─ Q: What should the administrator do when he realizes that a consumer debtor cannot
│     continue with the payments required under a consumer proposal?
│
├─ A: ✅ A) Advise the consumer debtor to consider filing an amendment to the consumer
│          proposal, prior to the proposal being deemed annulment
│
├─ Quote: §66.31(1) provides for deemed annulment after 3 payments/3 months default.
│          §66.31(2) states "If an amendment to a consumer proposal filed before the deemed
│          annulment... is withdrawn or refused... the consumer proposal is deemed to be
│          annulled at the time that the amendment is withdrawn or refused."
│
├─ Why: The administrator's best practice is to help debtor file an amendment BEFORE deemed
│        annulment occurs. §66.31(2) implies amendments can be filed to prevent/delay deemed
│        annulment. Option B is wrong (no requirement to call meeting). Option C is wrong
│        (OSB notification is not primary action). Option D is wrong (administrator doesn't
│        "apply" for annulment - it happens automatically per §66.31(1), or court annuls per §66.3).

## Q5: When Can Creditor Terminate Agreement?

**Question:** When may a creditor terminate or amend any agreement with a debtor who has filed a consumer proposal?
- A) When the consumer debtor has consulted an Administrator with regards to filing a proposal
- B) When the proposal has been accepted/deemed accepted by the creditors
- C) When the proposal has been approved/deemed approved by the court
- D) When the proposal has been withdrawn

```
┌─ Q: When may a creditor terminate or amend any agreement with a debtor who has filed
│     a consumer proposal?
│
├─ A: ✅ D) When the proposal has been withdrawn
│
├─ Quote: "If a notice of intention or a proposal has been filed... no person may terminate
│          or amend any agreement... by reason only that... a proposal has been filed"  §65.1(1)
│
│          "This section ceases to apply where the consumer proposal is refused by the
│          creditors or by the court, or is withdrawn, annulled or deemed annulled."  §66.35(4)
│
├─ Why: §65.1 protects agreements from termination during proposal process. §66.35(4) lists
│        when this protection ENDS: withdrawn, refused, annulled. Options A-C all occur while
│        proposal is active (still protected). Only when withdrawn does protection end.

## Q6: Can Proposal Be Withdrawn After Filing with OR?

**Question:** Can a proposal filed under Division II be withdrawn after the proposal has been filed with the Official Receiver?
- A) Only with prior approval of the Official Receiver
- B) Only before the mailing of the notice to creditors
- C) Only before the acceptance or deemed acceptance by creditors
- D) Only before the approval or deemed approval by court

§66.25 states: "A consumer debtor may withdraw... (a) at any time before its deemed approval by the court"

**Answer: D) Only before the approval or deemed approval of the court**

```
┌─ Q: Can a proposal filed under Division II be withdrawn after filing with the OR?
│
├─ A: ✅ D) Only before the approval or deemed approval of the court
│
├─ Quote: "A consumer debtor may withdraw a consumer proposal (a) at any time before its
│          deemed approval by the court by virtue of subsection 66.22(2), where no court
│          review is requested; or (b) where a court review is requested, at any time before
│          its actual approval or refusal by the court pursuant to section 66.24."  §66.25
│
├─ Why: §66.25 allows withdrawal "before deemed approval by court" or "before actual approval/
│        refusal" if hearing requested. This means debtor CAN withdraw even after creditor
│        acceptance (eliminates option C). No OR approval needed (eliminates A). Can withdraw
│        after notice sent (eliminates B). Once court approves, withdrawal not allowed.

## Q7: Deemed Acceptance by Creditors

**Question:** Which one of the following constitute a deemed acceptance of the consumer proposal by the creditors?
- A) When there is no quorum at a meeting of creditors
- B) When 25% of the proven creditors have dissented to the proposal
- C) When the major creditor has voted in favour of the proposal no matter the amount of the claim
- D) When all proven related party creditors have voted in favour of the proposal

§66.18(2): "Where there is no quorum at a meeting of creditors, the consumer proposal **shall be deemed to be accepted** by the creditors."

**Answer: A) When there is no quorum at a meeting of creditors**

```
┌─ Q: Which one of the following constitute a deemed acceptance of the consumer proposal
│     by the creditors?
│
├─ A: ✅ A) When there is no quorum at a meeting of creditors
│
├─ Quote: "Where there is no quorum at a meeting of creditors, the consumer proposal shall
│          be deemed to be accepted by the creditors."  §66.18(2)
│
├─ Why: §66.18(2) is explicit - no quorum = deemed accepted. This is unique to consumer
│        proposals (favors debtor). Option B is wrong (25% dissenting doesn't matter - need
│        majority voting NO to refuse). Option C is wrong (one creditor can't determine outcome,
│        need majority). Option D is wrong (§66.19(2) says related creditors can vote AGAINST
│        but not FOR, so they can't cause acceptance).

## Q8: Effect on Creditors Upon Approval

**Question:** Which one of the following statements is true with respect to the effect on different creditors upon the approval of a consumer proposal?
- A) All secured creditors are bound by the terms of proposal
- B) All unsecured creditors, whether they voted for or against the proposal, are bound by the terms of the proposal
- C) Only secured creditors who voted in favour of the proposal are bound by the terms of the proposal
- D) Only secured creditors to whom the proposal was made and did not vote are bound

§66.28(2): "binding on creditors in respect of (a) **all unsecured claims**"

**Answer: B) All unsecured creditors, whether they voted for or against, are bound**

```
┌─ Q: Which statement is true with respect to effect on different creditors upon approval?
│
├─ A: ✅ B) All unsecured creditors, whether they voted for or against the proposal, are
│          bound by the terms of the proposal
│
├─ Quote: "a consumer proposal accepted, or deemed accepted, by the creditors and approved,
│          or deemed approved, by the court is binding on creditors in respect of (a) all
│          unsecured claims"  §66.28(2)(a)
│
├─ Why: §66.28(2)(a) says "ALL unsecured claims" are bound - whether they voted for, against,
│        or didn't vote at all. Once approved, all unsecured creditors must accept the terms.
│        Option A is wrong (secured creditors only bound if filed proof per §66.28(2)(b)).
│        Options C and D are wrong (secured creditor binding depends on filing proof, not voting).
│
├─ Cross-Refs: §66.28(2)(b) (secured must file proof), §62(2) (Division I similar binding)

## Q9: When is Proposal Deemed Annulled?

**Question:** A consumer proposal is deemed to be annulled when:
- A) Payments monthly or more frequent and debtor in default for ≥ 3 payments
- B) Payments monthly or more frequent and debtor in default for > 1 month
- C) Payments less frequent than monthly and debtor in default for equivalent of 3 months
- D) Payments less frequent than monthly and debtor in default for equivalent of 1 month

§66.31(1): Two scenarios based on payment frequency

**Answer: A) Payments monthly or more frequently and debtor in default for amount equal to or more than 3 payments**

```
┌─ Q: When is a consumer proposal deemed to be annulled?
│
├─ A: ✅ A) Payments are to be made monthly or more frequently and the consumer debtor is
│          in default for an amount that is equal to, or more than, the amount of three payments
│
├─ Quote: "a consumer proposal is deemed to be annulled on (a) in the case when payments
│          under the consumer proposal are to be made monthly or more frequently, the day on
│          which the consumer debtor is in default for an amount that is equal to or more
│          than the amount of three payments"  §66.31(1)(a)
│
├─ Why: This is word-for-word from §66.31(1)(a). Note it's the AMOUNT equal to 3 payments,
│        not necessarily 3 separate missed payments. Option B is wrong (1 month insufficient).
│        Option C is partially correct (§66.31(1)(b) for less frequent payments) but option A
│        is more complete/common scenario. Option D is wrong (need 3 months equivalent, not 1).
│

## Q10: When Can Debtor File Second Consumer Proposal?

**Question:** When can a consumer debtor file a second Consumer Proposal with respect to the same debts?
- A) Upon the obtaining of a court order to do so
- B) Upon the approval of the majority of the creditors
- C) Upon completion of the terms of the original proposal despite annulment or default
- D) At any time

§66.32(1)(a): "may NOT make another consumer proposal... until all claims... are either paid in full or extinguished"

**Answer: A) Upon obtaining a court order to do so**

```
┌─ Q: When can a consumer debtor file a second Consumer Proposal with respect to same debts?
│
├─ A: ✅ A) Upon the obtaining of a court order to do so
│
├─ Quote: "Unless the court otherwise orders, where a consumer proposal is annulled or deemed
│          annulled, the consumer debtor (a) may not make another consumer proposal... until
│          all claims for which proofs of claim were filed and accepted are either paid in
│          full or are extinguished by the operation of subsection 178(2)."  §66.32(1)
│
├─ Why: §66.32(1) starts with "Unless the court otherwise orders" - this means court CAN
│        grant permission to file another proposal. Without court order, must wait until all
│        claims paid in full or extinguished. Option B is wrong (creditor approval not
│        sufficient). Option C is misleading (if completed successfully, can file new proposal
│        for different debts, but question asks about "same debts"). Option D is wrong (cannot
│        file at any time - restrictions apply).

## Q11: What Constitutes Quorum?

**Question:** What constitutes a quorum at a meeting of creditors in a consumer proposal?
- A) A person, other than proxy holder, employed by creditor who filed claim and intends to vote
- B) A proven creditor who has provided a voting letter in advance
- C) The majority of creditors listed on Statement of Affairs
- D) The physical presence of a creditor who has filed proof of claim

From Directive 22R4 (fetched earlier): "at least one creditor... having filed and proven their claim... A voting letter... can also establish quorum"

**Answer: B) A proven creditor who has provided a voting letter in advance of the meeting**

```
┌─ Q: What constitutes a quorum at a meeting of creditors in a consumer proposal?
│
├─ A: ✅ B) A proven creditor who has provided a voting letter in advance of the meeting
│
├─ Quote: Directive 22R4 states quorum is "at least one creditor present in person, or by any
│          other means, or represented by a proxyholder...eligible to vote, by having filed
│          and proven their claim" and "A voting letter filed in a proposal with a proven
│          claim can also establish quorum"
│
├─ Why: Directive 22R4 explicitly allows voting letters to establish quorum in consumer
│        proposals. Option A is wrong (employee of creditor doesn't count). Option C is wrong
│        (doesn't matter how many listed on SOA - need only 1 proven claim). Option D is wrong
│        (physical presence not required - voting letter sufficient).

## Q12: When Must Administrator Call Meeting?

**Question:** When must the administrator call a meeting of creditors in a consumer proposal?
- A) When creditors requesting meeting represent 25% in value of the voting creditors
- B) When creditors requesting meeting represent 25% in value of creditors having filed proof of claim
- C) When, after 45 days of filing, no creditor has filed proof of claim
- D) When 50% of creditors vote against the proposal

§66.15(2)(b): "if... creditors having in the aggregate at least **twenty-five per cent in value of the proven claims** have so requested"

**Answer: B) When creditors requesting meeting represent 25% in value of creditors having filed proof of claim**

```
┌─ Q: When must the administrator call a meeting of creditors in a consumer proposal?
│
├─ A: ✅ B) When the creditors requesting meeting represent 25% in value of the creditors
│          having filed a proof of claim with the administrator
│
├─ Quote: "The administrator shall call a meeting of creditors... at the expiration of the
│          forty-five day period following the filing of the consumer proposal, if at that
│          time creditors having in the aggregate at least twenty-five per cent in value of
│          the proven claims have so requested"  §66.15(2)(b)
│
├─ Why: §66.15(2)(b) specifies "proven claims" not "voting creditors." Proven claims = those
│        who filed proof of claim with administrator. Option A is wrong (says "voting creditors"
│        not "proven claims"). Option C is wrong (no claims filed = deemed accepted, not meeting).
│        Option D is wrong (can't vote before meeting is called).

## Q13: True Statement About Consumer Proposals

**Question:** Which one of the following statements is true with regards to a consumer proposal?
- A) Only the creditors that have voted on the consumer proposal are bound by the terms
- B) The secured creditors, other than a mortgagor, are bound by the consumer proposal
- C) Creditors voting against the proposal do not constitute a deemed request for a meeting
- D) There are no inspectors appointed in a consumer proposal

Looking at the sections: §66.28(2) says ALL unsecured bound, inspectors are rarely used in consumer proposals...

**Answer: D) There are no inspectors appointed in a consumer proposal**

```
┌─ Q: Which statement is true with regards to a consumer proposal?
│
├─ A: ✅ D) There are no inspectors appointed in a consumer proposal
│
├─ Quote: Division II (consumer proposals) does not include provisions for inspector
│          appointment. Inspector provisions are in Division I (§56). Study materials (5.3)
│          confirm inspectors are only involved if debtor was already bankrupt when filing.
│
├─ Why: Consumer proposals don't typically have inspectors - this is a Division I feature.
│        Option A is WRONG (§66.28(2)(a) says "ALL unsecured claims" bound, not just voters).
│        Option B is WRONG (secured only bound if filed proof per §66.28(2)(b)). Option C is
│        WRONG (voting against is irrelevant to meeting request - need ≥25% to REQUEST meeting
│        per §66.15(2)(b), not vote against).

## Q14: When is Consumer Proposal Deemed Accepted?

**Question:** When is a consumer proposal deemed accepted?
- A) When the majority of creditors, based on number and value of claims, vote in favour
- B) All creditors must have voted on the proposal
- C) After 45 days of filing, if creditors' meeting not requested
- D) When there is a quorum at a creditors meeting

§66.18(1): "at the expiration of the forty-five day period... no obligation... to call meeting... deemed to be accepted"

**Answer: C) After 45 days of the filing of the proposal, if creditors' meeting not requested**

```
┌─ Q: When is a consumer proposal deemed accepted?
│
├─ A: ✅ C) After 45 days of the filing of the proposal, if creditors' meeting not requested
│
├─ Quote: "Where, at the expiration of the forty-five day period following the filing of
│          the consumer proposal, no obligation has arisen under subsection 66.15(2) to call
│          a meeting of creditors, the consumer proposal is deemed to be accepted by the
│          creditors."  §66.18(1)
│
├─ Why: This is the primary "deemed acceptance" mechanism - automatic acceptance after 45 days
│        if no meeting requested. Option A describes active voting (not deemed). Option B is
│        wrong (creditors don't need to vote at all for deemed acceptance). Option D is wrong
│        (quorum triggers voting, not deemed acceptance - though §66.18(2) says NO quorum also
│        = deemed accepted).

## Q15: What May Occur at Creditors' Meeting?

**Question:** Which of the following may occur at the creditors' meeting in a consumer proposal?
- A) The proposal may be amended by the consumer debtor
- B) Provision for supervision of debtor's affairs without consent
- C) The appointment of up to 5 inspectors
- D) The creditors may vote by special resolutions

§66.19: Creditors may "accept or refuse the consumer proposal as filed **or as altered at the meeting**"

**Answer: A) The proposal may be amended by the consumer debtor**

```
┌─ Q: Which of the following may occur at the creditors' meeting in a consumer proposal?
│
├─ A: ✅ A) The proposal may be amended by the consumer debtor
│
├─ Quote: "At a meeting of creditors, the creditors may by ordinary resolution, voting all
│          as one class, accept or refuse the consumer proposal as filed or as altered at
│          the meeting or any adjournment thereof"  §66.19(1)
│
├─ Why: §66.19(1) allows proposal to be "altered at the meeting" - this means amendments are
│        permitted. Study materials (5.3.14) confirm "proposal can also be amended at the
│        meeting, but only if the debtor agrees." Option B is wrong (cannot impose supervision
│        without consent). Option C is wrong (inspectors not typically appointed in consumer
│        proposals - that's Division I §56). Option D is wrong (§66.19(1) says "ordinary
│        resolution" not "special resolution").
